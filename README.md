# SDSTodolist
Our project is basically a to do list webapp which is an ultimate productivity app. 
A to-do list app lets you write, organize, and reprioritize your day to day tasks more efficiently.
In this we add our tasks in a text bar which gets sequentially arranged below it on clicking the + icon.
Also we have provided a feature of checkbox in front of every task and a dustbin icon at the end of it.
Clicking the checkbox will simply strikethrough our task suggesting that it has been done. 
Whereas on clicking the dustbin icon ,the task will get removed from the list permanently.
It also includes a line saying the number of tasks pending to do which continuously reminds the user.
Whenever we strikethrough or delete any task, the number of pending tasks decreases its count. 
Talking about the tech stuff , we have used HTML,CSS and Javascript and used VS code for the programming platform.
We've have tried to make this user-friendly and fulfilling.
